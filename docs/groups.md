# Sending group messages

The API request to send group messages is similar to the [individual message request](/docs/outbound/#sending-imessages). 

## API Request

The API request should be made with the `application/json` content type header. If the group does not exist during the request, it will be created automatically.

### Endpoint

 `POST https://api.sendblue.co/api/send-group-message`

### POST Body (JSON)

The group messaging API expects a slightly different json body than the individual message api. Here are the available fields:

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| numbers | `array` | numbers is an array of `strings` which contain the E.164-formatted phone numbers of the desired recipients in a group chat. The maximum number of people allowed in a group chat is 25. |
| group_id | `string` | The group_id field is a uuid with which you can message groups that you have already created. This is the same as passing the same list of numbers as was passed in the initial request |
| media_url | `string` | A CDN link to a file which is publicly accessible which will be downloaded and sent to the group on our end |
| statusCallback | `string` | An endpoint which we can hit to notify your app of status updates for this message, see [status callback](/docs/outbound#status-callback) for more info |

### Example

``` js
const url = `https://api.sendblue.co/api/send-group-message`;

axios.post(url, {
    numbers: [
        '+19998887777',
        '+17778889999'
    ],
    content: 'Hello group!',
    media_url: 'https://source.unsplash.com/random.png',
    statusCallback: 'https://example.com/message-status/1234abcd',
},
headers: {
    "sb-api-key-id": << apiKey >> ,
    "sb-api-secret-key": << apiSecret >> ,
    "content-type": "application/json"
},
}).then(response => {
    console.log(response.data);
}).catch(error => {
    console.error(error);
});
```

## API Response

The API response will contain the assigned group_id, which is useful for correlating messages sent to a group and messages received from a group. 

:::info Note
The `group_id` that you receive in the response from `/api/send-group-message` is the only way you will be able to correlate messages sent in a group to messages received from a group in your app.

#### Example

See the example below to see what our response body looks like. Note that this API is still in Beta so the fields below are subject to change.

``` json
{
    "accountEmail": "nikita.jerschow@gmail.com",
    "content": "please",
    "is_outbound": true,
    "status": "QUEUED",
    "error_code": null,
    "error_message": null,
    "message_handle": "073c1408-a6d9-48e2-ae8c-01f026443833",
    "date_sent": "2021-05-19T23:07:23.371Z",
    "date_updated": "2021-05-19T23:07:23.371Z",
    "from_number": "+13322175641",
    "number": [
        "+19173599290",
        "+18582430295"
    ],
    "to_number": [
        "+19173599290",
        "+18582430295"
    ],
    "was_downgraded": null,
    "plan": "blue",
    "media_url": "https://source.unsplash.com/random.png",

    "group_id": "66e3b90d-4447-43c6-9439-15a694408ac2"
}
```

:::caution
the `number` and `to_number` fields will likely be renamed to `numbers` and `to_numbers` respectively.

# Receiving Group Messages

Receiving group messages is very straightforward. There will be a field called group_id which gets sent to your [receive webhook](/docs/inbound).
